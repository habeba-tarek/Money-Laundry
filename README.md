This project aims to detect suspicious financial activities—particularly money laundering—using synthetic banking transaction data generated by IBM's AMLSim. Leveraging advanced data preprocessing, threshold-based alerting, and machine learning models, the system is designed to identify fraudulent accounts and transactions with high accuracy.
